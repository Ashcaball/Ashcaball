### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ashley Caballero 

Welcome to my Portfolio that contains all of the SQL code that I have been learning. When a repository is named as a Project, it contains code and a link to a Tableau visualization. Repositories named as "case studies" are SQL codes with no visualization attatched.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating a porfolio to land a job as a data analyst
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning SQL and Tableau
- ðŸŽ“ I graduated December 2021 from Michigan State University... Go Green!
