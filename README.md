### Hi there 👋 I'm Ashley Caballero 

Welcome to my Portfolio that contains all of the SQL code that I have been learning since January 2022. When a repository is named as a "project", it contains code and a link to a Tableau visualization pretaining to the data. Repositories named as "case studies" are SQL codes with no visualization attatched.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on creating a porfolio to land a job as a data analyst
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL and Tableau
- 🎓 I graduated December 2021 from Michigan State University... Go Green!
